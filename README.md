It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/): Is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.
* [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/): is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment
